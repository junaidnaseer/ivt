For this application to run OpenCV is needed. The project settings
assume that OpenCV 2.1 is installed in the director C:\OpenCV2.1.

A pdf containing a suitable 9x7 checkerboard calibration pattern
can be found in IVT/examples/CalibrationApp/checkerboard.pdf.

The files .sln, .vcxproj and .vcxproj.filters are Visual Studio 2010 files.
Open the solution file .sln to load the project.

The files .dsp and .dsw are Visual Studio 6 files are automatically
converted by Visual Studio versions until Visual Studio 2008. Open the
workspace file .dsw and let automatically convert all files to load the
project. For Visual Studio 2005 and newer, among others a solution file .sln
will be generated (it will overwrite the existing Visual Studio 2010 .sln file),
which is to be used for loading the project later on.
