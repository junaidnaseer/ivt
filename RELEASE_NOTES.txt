This is the release of version 1.3.22 of the IVT.

Changes:

- IVT/src/Image/ByteImage.cpp:
  In CByteImage::SaveToFile(...) initialized padding bytes so that valgrind will not print
  out "uninitialized bytes". This was not a bug, as the padding bytes are not used and do 
  not have to contain valid data.

- IVT/src/Image/ImageProcessor.cpp:
  Added check for all Gaussian filters that image must be at least as large as the kernel size.

- IVT/src/Math/LinearAlgebra.cpp:
  In CLinearAlgebra::DetermineAffineTransformation(...) and CLinearAlgebra::DetermineHomography(...)
  handling result value of SolveLinearLeastSquaresSimple(...) now.

- IVT/src/Structs/ObjectDefinitions.h:
  Added localizationFlag to struct Object3DEntry.
  Changed order of colors in ObjectColor and added eNumberOfColors at the end.

- IVT/examples/HSVColorSegmentationApp/src/ObjetFinderOrganizer.cpp:
  Adapted to changes in ObjectColor.

- IVT/src/ObjectFinder/CompactRegionFilter.cpp:
  Small fixed parameter change in CCompactRegionFilter::CheckRegion(...).

- IVT/src/VideoCapture/Linux1394Capture2.cpp:
  Added CLinux1394Capture2::GetVideoMode(...) and CLinux1394Capture2::GetFrameRate(...)
  and applied some improvments.

- Non-functional modifications to avoid warnings.
